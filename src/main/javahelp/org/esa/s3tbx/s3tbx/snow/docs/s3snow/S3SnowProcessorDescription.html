<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/s3snow_io.png"></p>

<h4>Source Product Group</h4>

<p class="i1">
    <b>OLCI L1b or Rayleigh corrected product: </b>
    Used to select the OLCI L1b source product. The user can specify either an original L1b product, or a product which
    has been Rayleigh corrected in a preprocessing step using the SNAP Rayleigh Correction processor. Using a Rayleigh
    corrected product as input will save significant computation time for the snow property retrieval, but note that
    the Rayleigh correction product MUST contain Rayleigh corrected reflectances for spectral bands 1, 5, 17
    and 21 (400, 510, 865 and 1020nm), and in addition for all manually selected spectral wavelengths (see processing
    parameter descriptions below). - If an original L1b product is set as input product, all required
    Rayleigh corrected reflectances will be computed from an internal call of the SNAP
    Rayleigh Correction processor.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    Use the <b>...</b> button to open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Cloud mask product (optional): </b>
    Used to select an optional source product providing a cloud mask. Usually this product should have been generated
    in a preprocessing step using the IdePix pixel classification tool in the specific version provided
    within the SEOM S3 for Snow project [1], but in principle this could be any kind
    of product containing a mask with values 1.0 indicating cloudy pixels and 0.0 otherwise. A mandatory condition
    to use this option is that the cloud mask product has been generated on the same raster (i.e. the same OLCI L1b
    product) which is considered for the snow properties retrieval.
</p>

<h4>Target Product Group</h4>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>


<h3>The Processing Parameters</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/s3snow_procparms.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Select OLCI wavelengths for spectral snow quantities: </b><br>
    The OLCI wavelengths considered for the retrieval of spectral snow quantities. For the selected wavelengths,
    the computed spectral snow quantities (i.e. spectral snow albedo, see description of processor output below)
    will be written as corresponding band into the target product. If no band is selected, only broadband snow
    quantities and other selected, wavelength-independent quantities are written to the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name of binary mask band in cloud mask product (if present): </b><br>
    The name of the binary mask band in cloud mask product (in case a cloud product was specified).
    If the IdePix pixel classification tool has been used to generate this product (the usual case), the cloud mask
    band has the default name 'cloud_over_snow'. If no cloud mask product was specified, this processing
    parameter has no effect.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Consider NDSI snow mask: </b><br>
    If selected, an NDSI value will be computed from Rayleigh reflectances at wavelengths 865 and 1020nm:<br><br>

    &emsp;&emsp; NDSI = (brr865 - brr1020) / (brr865 + brr1020) <br><br>

    The considered pixel will be interpreted as snow pixel if
</p>

<ul class="i1">
    <li>
        the NDSI exceeds a threshold which is given in the
        parameter below.
    </li>
    <li>
        the Rayleigh reflectance at OLCI band 1 (400nm) is greater than 0.5.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="i1">
    The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>NDSI threshold for snow identification: </b><br>
    If an NDSI snow mask is considered (previous parameter), the considered pixel will be interpreted as snow pixel if
    the NDSI exceeds the threshold specified here, and if the Rayleigh reflectance at OLCI band 1 (400nm) is greater
    than 0.5. The default number is 0.03.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Consider snow pollution: </b><br>
    If selected, a test for snow pollution is applied for the considered snow pixel. The snow pixel is regarded as
    'polluted' if the Rayleigh reflectance at OLCI band 1 (400nm) is lower than the difference of
    a so-called 'R_0 threshold' and another user parameter 'snow pollution threshold' which is specified below. The
    retrieval of the 'R_0 threshold' is described in detail in the ATBD [2]. - If the snow pixel is identified as polluted, a
    specific snow property algorithm is applied which deviates from the clean snow retrieval. Details are described
    in the ATBD [2].
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Write additional parameters (f, l, m, R_0) in case of polluted snow (expert option): </b><br>
    If selected, additional parameters related to polluted snow will be computed for the pixels identified as
    'polluted' (see above) and written to the target product. The interpretation of these parameters requires
    detailed knowledge of the underlying algorithm, therefore this user parameter is considered as an 'expert option'.
    The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Write uncertainties of additional parameters in case of polluted snow (expert option): </b><br>
    If selected together with the previous processing parameter, uncertainties of the additional parameters related to
    polluted snow (see previous processing parameter) will be computed for the pixels identifies as 'polluted'
    (see above) and written to the target product. The interpretation of these uncertainties requires
    detailed knowledge of the underlying algorithm, therefore this user parameter is also considered as an 'expert option'.
    The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Assumed uncertainty of Rayleigh corrected reflectances: </b><br>
    The assumed uncertainty of Rayleigh corrected reflectances, used for the error propagation applied with the previous
    processing parameter. Default values is 0.01.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Snow pollution threshold: </b><br>
    Threshold for identification of polluted snow, as explained above with the processing parameter
    'Consider snow pollution'. Default values is 0.1.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute PPA: </b><br>
    If selected, the spectral probability of photon absorption (PPA) is written to the target product
    for each selected OLCI waveelngth. The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Copy reflectance bands: </b><br>
    If selected, the mandatory Rayleigh corrected reflectances for spectral bands 1, 5, 17
    and 21 (400, 510, 865 and 1020nm), computed internally or provided with Rayleigh correction input product,
    and in addition the Rayleigh corrected reflectances for all manually selected spectral wavelengths are
    written to the target product. The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>OLCI reference wavelength: </b><br>
    Reference wavelength used in the snow property algorithms. See the ATBD [2] for details. Default value is 1020nm.
</p>

<p class="i1">

    OLCI system vicarious calibration (SVC) gain for band 1 (400nm). See [3] for details and explanations.
    Default value is 0.9798, as proposed in [3], Table 2.

<p class="i1">
    <b>OLCI SVC gain for band 5 (510nm): </b><br>
    OLCI system vicarious calibration (SVC) gain for band 5 (510nm). See [3] for details and explanations.
    Default value is 0.9892, as proposed in [3], Table 2.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>OLCI SVC gain for band 17 (865nm): </b><br>
    OLCI system vicarious calibration (SVC) gain for band 17 (865nm). See [3] for details and explanations.
    Default value is 1.0, as proposed in [3], Table 2.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>OLCI SVC gain for band 21 (1020nm): </b><br>
    OLCI system vicarious calibration (SVC) gain for band 1 (400nm). See [3] for details and explanations.
